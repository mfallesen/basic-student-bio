    <p>My name is Mike and I'm happy to be here. Ive been dabbling with code since my wife introduced me a few years back and Ive decided that I should take the plunge and pursue it as a career. I'm an Army veteran and first generation Swedish/American. After the military I spent 6 years working in security for luxury condos in South Beach before getting a degree in English Literature.  Really lookign forward to this opportunity to work with everyone as it will be the first time I'm able to work with anyone on a development project.</p>
